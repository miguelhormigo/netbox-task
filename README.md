# NetBox Automation Scripts

This repository contains custom scripts to automate NetBox operations, including:

- **Initializing NetBox with Sites, Racks, Device Roles, Device Types, and Devices**
- **Filtering and printing device reports in YAML format**
- **Querying device counts via the NetBox API**

These scripts are designed for use with **NetBox running on Docker (WSL)** and can be executed via the Web UI or CLI.
